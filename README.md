# Na√Øve Bees
**first step: **
# Image Loading and Processing
- loading the bumble and honey bees images and manipulating them using the PIL library
- making a pipeline with converting the loaded images to grayscale to eventually save them

**libraries used= ** PIL, numpy, matplotlib
**second step: **
# Predict Species from Images
- building a binary classifier using supervised learning to detect honey bees and bumble bees in images.
- data visualisation using Matplotlib
- Generate the row of features after flattening them into a single row
- split into train and test data
- Scaling the data using StandardScaler
- Performing dimension reduction using PCA


**libraries used+= ** sklearn, skimage
**third step: **
# Deep Learning with Images
